# Meshtasticator
Discrete-event and interactive simulator for [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/). 

## Remodel: Web Interface Bridge ("Digital Twin")
This project has been remodeled to support a React-based Web Interface driven by the Python Simulator via WebSockets.

### Quick Start
1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    cd web && npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Simulator (Backend):**
    ```bash
    # Runs the Python backend with WebSocket Server on port 8765
    python3 interactiveSim.py 3
    ```

3.  **Run the Web Interface (Frontend):**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open http://localhost:5173

### Features
*   **Real-time Bridge:** Node positions and packets are broadcast from Python to the Web UI.
*   **Mock Mode:** On systems without Docker (or if it crashes), the simulator enters "Mock Mode" to keep the UI connection alive.
*   **Interactive:** Use the Python CLI to send messages (`broadcast 0 "hello"`) and see packets in the terminal (UI visualization pending full implementation).

## Discrete-event simulator
The discrete-event simulator mimics the radio section of the device software in order to understand its working. It can also be used to assess the performance of your scenario, or the scalability of the protocol. 

See [this document](DISCRETE_EVENT_SIM.md) for a usage guide. 

After a simulation, it plots the placement of nodes and time schedule for each set of overlapping messages that were sent.

It can be used to analyze the network for a set of parameters. For example, these are the results of 100 simulations of 200s with a different hop limit and number of nodes. As expected, the average number of nodes reached for each generated message increases as the hop limit increases.

However, it comes at the cost of usefulness, i.e., the amount of received packets that contain a new message (not a duplicate due to rebroadcasting) out of all packets received.

## Interactive simulator
The interactive simulator uses the [Linux native application of Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/development/linux/), i.e. the real device software, while simulating some of the hardware interfaces, including the LoRa chip. Can also be used on a Windows or macOS host with Docker.

See [this document](INTERACTIVE_SIM.md) for a usage guide. 

It allows for debugging multiple communicating nodes without having real devices.

Furthermore, since the simulator has an 'oracle view' of the network, it allows to visualize the route messages take.
